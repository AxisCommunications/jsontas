    Wait for a query tree to evaluate to True.

    Example::
        {

                "for": {
                    "$request": {

    Request example.com until a non-null response. Maximum 1 request/s for 20s

    Due to the storage of the 'query_tree' in dataset it is possible to nest queries::

    Example::
